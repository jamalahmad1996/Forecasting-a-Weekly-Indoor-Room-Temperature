# Forecasting-a-Weekly-Indoor-Room-Temperature
Forecasting indoor temperature of buildings has many potential applications. Most important of them is forecasting of energy consumption of a building. Using energy consumption forecasting, a better energy management plan can be made to achieve energy efficiency. The weekly indoor temperature was forecasted using machine learning and classical methods. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is reported and the best model is recommended. The results showed that machine learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory and multiple linear regression outperform the classical time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA and Vector Autoregression. Moreover, adding seasonality component to the ARIMA model improved the forecasting results.
