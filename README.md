# Forecasting-a-Weekly-Indoor-Room-Temperature
This is a final project for Internet of Things Engineering (ENGR 651) class that I have taken in Spring semester of 2020 at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Forecasting indoor temperature of buildings has many potential applications. Most important of them is forecasting of energy consumption of a building. Using energy consumption forecasting, a better energy management plan can be made to achieve energy efficiency. In the present work, indoor room temperature of different rooms in the building of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette was predicted based on the historical data. There are temperature and humidity sensors in almost every room in the building. And the data from all these sensors have been recorded in the server for one and half years. These historical data from indoor sensors as well as outside historical temperature data was used in this work to predict the weekly indoor temperature of different rooms of the building using machine learning and classical methods. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is reported and the best model is recommended. The results showed that machine learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory and multiple linear regression outperform the classical time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA and Vector Autoregression. Moreover, adding seasonality component to the ARIMA model improved the forecasting results.
